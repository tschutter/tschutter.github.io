Introduction
============

In late summer of 2018, I bikepacked the Colorado Trail solo.  It was
the longest and most difficult thing I had ever done.  But it was also
the most satisfying.

Despite all of my planning and preparation, I had no idea exactly how
long this trip would take.  I just did not know how many miles I could
do each day.  In the end it took me 18 days, but if my derailleur had
not self-destructed I probably could have done it in 16.

Equipment and Packing List
==========================

I got lucky with my equipment selection.  The only exceptions were:

- I did not use most of the first aid kit, but that was a good thing.
- I did not use most of the bike tools, again a good thing.
- I did not use the pair of Gortex socks.
- The sleeping bag was a little too light for sleeping in the hammock
  which I solved mid-trip by picking up the Therm-a-Rest sleeping pad.
- The cell phone was a PITA.  I usually had it in power saving mode
  which reduced the screen brightness to a minimum.  When I saw a
  picture that I wanted to take, I would have to stop, pull out the
  phone, figure out how to increase the brightness when I could not
  see the dim screen, take the pic, put the phone away.  Probably
  would have been better to pay the weight penalty with a separate
  camera.

Some useful discussions and packing lists that I referenced:

Day 1 - Saturday 2018-08-25
===========================

I met Rachel and Liam from New Mexico in the parking lot.  They are
thru biking to Durango.

I saw a bighorn sheep right after first short steep climb.  He was
probably only 20 feet away from me.

Met a pair of older thru hikers.

Young girl hiking to Telluride in 5 to 7 weeks.

Stopped at quartz mine for lunch.  I rested and waited for clouds
before I traversed the Hayman burn area.

Camped at intersection with Redskin Creek Trail.

Day 2 - Sunday 2018-08-26
=========================

Liam and Rachel passed me before I got moving in the morning.  But I
passed them mid-day.

I ran into a hail storm at 14:00.

I pushed hard to get to the Stagestop Saloon to get a burger and
fries.  The vision of a greasy cheeseburger gave me the motivation to
power through the many miles of pavement along highway 77.  When I
arrived at 19:20 I discovered that the last call in 10 minutes.  And
the kitchen was closed.  All that work for nothing!  I pounded two
beers in those 10 minutes.

I told the bartender that I was leaving to find a campsite.  She told
me that the owner let bikepackers sleep out back.  That was a total
relief because I was dead tired.  The downside was that I had to sleep
on a chipboard platform.  Soon it started raining and the tarp roof
was leaky, so I moved under the picnic table.  This was a 70 mile day.
Way too much.  In hindsight, I doubt that I could have eaten that
burger and fries.  In fact, I just had a handful of bar snack mix for
dinner.

Day 3 - Monday 2018-08-27
=========================

I had oatmeal and hot chocolate for breakfast.  Then the owner came
out and asked if I wanted anything from the store.  So I also had a
microwaved sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit and a chocolate milk!
Passed a young female thru hiker with a 30 day budget.

Met a 60ish thru hiker who left Durango on July 29.

Just past Georgia pass, I passed a French couple hiking from Waterton
to Gunnison.  She was extremely tired.

Day 4 - Tuesday 2018-08-28
==========================

I froze my ass off last night. Probably set up camp too close to the
water.  And I need to bring more clothes into the hammock.

I passed a young guy from New Zealand thru hiking the CDT!  He started
June 29 on a 100 day budget.  He was hiking extra light except for 2.8
pounds of camera gear.  As I was talking to him, 2 guys in their 40s
came eastbound thru biking the CT.  One of them gave me a joint.

Had lunch by Blue River bike bridge. Sweet and spicy tuna on
tortillas.  Yummy.

Met a middle aged couple thru packing the CDT northbound.

Day 5 - Wednesday 2018-08-29
============================

Again I froze my ass off last night.  Maybe the fly is to high.  Also
a good idea to get my face as close as possible to the screen so my
moisture laden breath goes out.

Took my first dump in 4 days!

Liam and Rachel caught up to me about a mile before the top of the
pass.  At that time we met an eastbound thru biker who started on
Thursday.  His goal was eight days.  He should be on leaderboard.
When we got to the bike path at Copper, Rachel noticed that my
handlebar bag was gone!  I went back up the trail about a mile before
I found it.  Luckily it was only a foot off of the trail, it could
have rolled hundreds of feet down the hill and I would have never
found it.

In the Conoco gas station right off of I-70, I pounded donuts, a huge
brownie, a chocolate milk, a large lemonade, and a package of
Taco-Litos.

2.5 miles up section 8, a spoke broke in my rear wheel.  I replaced it
with the FiberFix and rolled on.

Day 6 - Thursday 2018-08-30
===========================

I slept better last night.

The Kiwi hiking the CDT passed me when I was breaking camp.  I never
saw him again.

It was very steep coming down from Kokomo Pass, but fun.

I met a young couple thru hiking form Denver to Salida with their
large dog.  They said that their distance was dropping each day as the
dog was losing endurance.

I rolled into Leadville at about 16:30 and went directly to the Cycles
of Life bike shop.  Unfortunately, they are only open from 10:00 to
18:00 like most other businesses in town, so I cannot pickup my bike
until late tomorrow morning.

Checked into an eclectic hostel called Inn the Clouds.  I grabbed a
loaner town bike and went to the Tennessee Pass Inn for a huge bison
burger with a fried egg, bacon, and BBQ sauce on it.

Had an amber ale at Periodic Brewing.

When returning to the hostel I met Ellen, a young woman who is thru
biking the CT.  I directed her to the hostel.  It turns out that she
is being held hostage by the bike shop as well.

Talked to John and planned on meeting him Sunday afternoon at the Mt.
Princeton Hot Springs.

Day 7 - Friday 2018-08-31
=========================

Had a big breakfast with two large chocolate milks at the Golden
Burro.

At 10:00 I picked up my bike from the bike shop.  Ellen was there
getting her shifter fixed.  It turned out that my front shifter was
broken as well.  The mechanic also replaced my rear brake pads.  I
picked up some taint lube, maybe that will help with my rash.

At about 13:00 I met three ex-army guys that were climbing
Mt. Elbert. They were carrying 40 to 60 pound packs with some Coors
Lite for the summit.  Crazy starting that late.  I told then to start
earlier next time and to carry whiskey instead.

Ellen caught up with me mid-day.  It was a surprise because I thought
she was ahead of me.  We rode the rest of the day together.  She is a
stronger climber whereas I am faster on the downhills.

Met a young thru hiker who started from Denver, did the Collegiate
West, then the Collegiate East, and then was going to hitch to Salida
to resupply and continue.

Day 8 - Saturday 2018-09-01
===========================

Rode with Ellen all day. She says I am faster, but she chugs along.
So after my breaks we are a good match.

Stopped in Buena Vista for a Mexican hot chocolate and a cinnamon
roll.  Also went to City Market.  Individual drink packets seem to be
a better deal than Nuun tablets.

I went over-the-bars when negotiating a small root on a downhill.
Luckily I fell into a slash pile, otherwise there was a significant
potential for pain.  I lost my sunglasses and did not realize it.
Luckily I stopped for water 500 ft later and realized that they were
missing and easily found them when I went back.

Then Ellen went down while were descending a dirt road.  She got
caught in a rut and washed out. She was lucky to escape with only some
road rash.

Mt. Princeton Hot Springs is much fancier than I remember.

A aerospace guy interning in Colorado Springs joined us for dinner.
Somehow he had his fuel container yet he had lost his stove.

Day 9 - Sunday 2018-09-02
=========================

I missed the remains of my cookie when packing up in the dark.  Some
critter pulled it out of the plastic wrap and ate around the edges.

Ellen rolled out at 07:15.  It took me an extra hour to get going.

I had problems with my rear derailleur, the chain kept coming off of
the lower jockey wheel.  It appeared bent, so I bent it back.  In
addition, I discovered that there was almost nothing left to my front
brake pads.  This caused me to be an hour late getting too the end of
Segment 14 where John was going to meet me.

But it turned out that Roo and Cecile were the ones to meet me.  They
hiked a couple hundred yards up the trail to greet me.  We then drove
down to Salida to go to Absolute Bicycles to get new brake pads and
have someone look at my derailleur.  Some guy who maybe actually did
not work there took a look.  He had a tattoo for the 2015 Tour Divide.
He said that it just needed some lube and slight adjustment.  In
hindsight I should have had him try to backpedaling which seemed to
cause problems.  He did not charge me for labor, just for the pads.

In the shop I met two guys that were biking the divide southbound.  I
do not remember how much time they had allocated.  They were on an
extreme financial budget.  They had a problem with a derailleur
hanger.  They had a spare that they were told was correct, but
unfortunately they had not verified it.

Got a burrito at Mo Burrito.  Ate 3/4s and saved the rest for dinner.

We returned to the trail head after a detour along Hwy 285 because Roo
took a wrong turn.  Replaced the front brake pads at which time I
found that one of the old pads was down to bare metal.  Then I stocked
up on food and went on my way.  But I forgot to grab a 8mm hex wrench
from my supply box.

I wanted to get over the hump on Segment 15 today, but I gave up 2
miles from the top at 18:00.  I did not think that I could get over
and down to a lower elevation before dark.  Unfortunately the whole
part of this valley is moist and swampy.  It is impossible to get far
from the water.

Day 10 - Monday 2018-09-03
==========================

In the middle of the night it started raining on and off.  Around
04:00 it settled down to a steady rain.  Since the sky was clear when
I went to bed, I had laid out my jersey and chamois out to air out.
Now they are soaked.

It turned out that I had camped much closer to the top than I thought,
it was less than 2 miles. It was barely misting as I started to climb,
but it turned to snow near the top.

About a mile past the shelter, I met a guy that was doing a day ride
and we rode together awhile.  But then I started having problems
backpedaling, and then shifting in the rear became very difficult.  We
stopped and to a look.  Again I noticed that the cage was bent.  But
then the other guy noticed that there was a crack in the cage near the
bottom.  So I put a zip tie on it to reinforce it.  That is when the
bottom part of one side of the cage just broke off.  I picked a low
gear that seemed to work and finished Segment 15 and then headed down
to Salida.  Luckily it was downhill all the way.  I could pedal almost
all the way until I got to Poncha Springs, at which point my chain
locked up, right next to the Tesla charging station.  From there I had
to coast all the way down to Absolute Bicycles.

Scot? replaced my rear derailleur and did not charge me for labor.  He
also adjusted my front derailleur.  There was a woman in the shop
whose voice sounder familiar, so I asked if she was Andrea.  She said
yes and I told her that I was sorry that I did not have any maple
flavored jelly beans.

I then went to Moonlight Pizza for a calzone and a beer.  By now it
was to late to start back up to the trail, especially because I had no
idea where to camp along the road.  So I checked into the Great
Western hotel and went next door to Soulcraft Brewing for a beer.
There I talked to a couple that had been biking in the region for the
long weekend.

Day 11 - Tuesday 2018-09-04
===========================

Staying at the hotel made it easy to dry out all of my stuff.  But
then I remembered that I should really pick up a pad to put under me
in the hammock to reduce heat loss. That is when I discovered that
nothing opened before 10:00.

Sitting on the path next to the Arkansas River waiting for the shop to
open, a guy walking his dog walked up and asked if I was touring.  I
immediately recognized his voice and I asked if his name was Matt and
he said yes.  I told him that I was sorry that I did not have any
maple flavored jelly beans.  I told my derailleur story and we talked
about riding the crowd ??? and Marshall pass.

Bought a Therm-a-Rest Z Lite Sleeping Pad at Salida Mountain Sports.
It is a full length pad, so I immediately pulled out my knife and cut
off a third of it and handed it back to the saleslady.  She asked what
she should do with it.  I said "make it a dog bed".  I had no need for
the extra bulk.  I ended up carrying the pad strapped to the top of my
handlebar bag.

I drank a quart of chocolate milk at the Poncha Springs market.

I passed a guy riding the CDT.  He rode from Oregon to Tennessee
earlier this summer.  8000 miles touring this year.  Rode with him for
4 miles.

At Tank 7 Creek, there were two ladies camping (one who tend your to
be Bridget from Quebec).  One (Bridget) is thru hiking southbound and
the other is doing Silverton to Breckenridge northbound.  Had a
difficult time finding a suitable location for my hammock.  It started
raining right as I finished setting up the hammock.  I Had to go to
bed with only a tablespoon of peanut butter for dinner.  I have a
cookie, but once I was in the hammock, it was inaccessible.

Day 12 - Wednesday 2018-09-05
=============================

It lightly rained early in the morning before I got up.  Luckily I got
a break and it stopped as I was packing up.  But then 15 minutes
before I was done, it started again so i had to finish in a rush.  I
did get a chance to eat some oatmeal and hot chocolate and my cookie!
Just as I was pulling away, I realized that I should put on my helmet
cover. So off with the over gloves, off with the fleece gloves, dig in
the pack for the cover, put it on, put the gloves on, put the over
gloves on. What a PITA!

In the first 5 minutes, it started to hail.

I saw a northbound thru hiker near the end of the segment, but I was
off of the trail lubing my taint and did not have much
conversation.  This was about when the rain stopped.

I wanted to visit the monument, but I passed it without seeing it.  I
did see it when I stopped at the end of the segment.

I met a northbound thru hiker as he wad stopping to put on his rain
jacket.  I am sure that it came off 30 minutes later.

It keeps alternating between intense sun and cold blowing wind.  Hard
to choose the right clothes.

Stopped to have lunch.  When I was done, I decided to pee just off the
trail because I was not expecting anyone to come along.  Just as I was
finishing, a young girl northbound thru from Texas caught me in the
act!  One of the first things that she mentioned was that there were
see couple of hikers close behind her.  Of course there were not.  It
must have been a safety statement.  She was going to stop halfway
through the trip because of ankle pain.  Her budget was 6 weeks.

In the early afternoon it started raining again.  At about 15:30 I
caught up with Bridget.  At this point I was considering stopping and
setting up camp because of the rain.  Bridget had paused under a tree
because of the rain, but she started again a few minutes after I
arrived.  If she could do it, then so could I.  So after a 15 minute
break, I started back up again.  At this point the rain had slacked
off.

I cannot say much about the scenery from Sargents Mesa.  Usually all I
could see was clouds above me, clouds at my elevation, or clouds below
me.

The trail was extremely rocky, so progress was slow. There was some
nice flowy singletrack at the end though.

Because of the late hour, I set up camp near the beginning of Segment
? Unfortunately right across the valley from the highway.  At least
the traffic is infrequent.

Day 13 - Thursday 2018-09-06
============================

I saw very few people today.

The first half of the detour was pretty desolate.  When I had lunch it
was very sunny and I was able to lay out my stuff in the grass to dry.
Once I got to half done lakes, a 25 to 30 mph headwind kicked up.  I
could not complain because it kept the storms away.  But 5 miles from
the top off Los Pinos pass, I was caught in the rain.  I kept seeing
what i thought might be moose tracks in the muddy road, but I was not
absolutely positive.  Then I came upon a moose in a beaver pond right
by the road!  It most have been 30 feet away!

Again, the elevation profile in the map book did not seem to match
reality.  I rode down Los Pinos pass in the rain, not very fun.  I was
going to camp once I got to the Cebolla Creek turn, but it was all
private property, so I was forced to keep riding.  I went through a
couple of very cool canyons at this point.  I ended up camping in a
USFS day use area right by the creek.  I prefer to not be so close to
water because of the humidity and the cold, but I was beat and could
look no further.  It was a 50 mile day.

Day 14 - Friday 2018-09-07
==========================

After Slumgullion Pass, I could see Baldy Cinco on the left.

This bypass was longer than I expected.  All the roads were dirt and
there was no hike-a-bike, but it was a long distance.

The beginning of Segment 21 had an extreme amount of hike-a-bike
mainly because of the rockiness of the trail.  I arrived at the yurt
in the late afternoon and I had had enough.  I talked to a thru hiker
who said that he recognized me from a few days before, but I did not
recognize him.  He had decided to not stay at the yurt and to push on
for a couple of miles.  I am glad that I stayed there because there
was poor camping beyond it.

There were 7 other people staying at the yurt.  A group of 4 from
Colorado Springs, a group of 2 from the same and a thru hiker guy from
Nevada.  The yurt only holds 8 so I was lucky to have a spot.

Day 15 - Saturday 2018-09-08
============================

The beginning of the day was slow because of the elevation and
rockiness of the trail.  A there was an extreme climb 3 miles after
the yurt.

Extremely beautiful.

3 marmots together before Cooney.

I had lunch in a beautiful valley 2 miles after the start of Segment
23 with a marmot and a pika.  The first half of the valley was smooth
singletrack, the second half was hike-a-bike.

Talked to a hiker that had already setup his camp at 1609 before
something saddle.  He was going from gambling to Silverton via Molas
Pass.

My target was to finish Segment 23 today so I could get below treeline
but it was slow going.  I ended up making a bivy out of my hammock for
the night.  I cut open my garbage bag and used it as a ground cloth.

When setting up camp, I realized that I had left my headlamp hanging
from the bunk bed rail at the yurt.

Day 16 - Sunday 2018-09-09
==========================

It started raining at about 04:30 today.  My bivy setup worked well
and I did not get wet, although there was water on one corner of the
garbage bag ground cloth.

While I was packing up I saw clouds a few hundred feet below me.

It was cold and I was short on water so I skipped breakfast.

The guaranteed water at 16.5? Was not there, just two mud flats.

Again there was a lot of hike-a-bike today.  Elevation was the biggest
reason.  Saw a lot of marmots.

I did not see anyone today on the trail except for a young woman day
hiker near the end of Segment 23 when I was getting water.

A quarter mile after getting water I went heads over heels over the
side of the trail down a scree slope.  Luckily I only fell about 8
feet.

The dirt road down from Stony Pass was very steep.

Lunch in Silverton at Avalanche Brewing Company was a Hawaiian pizza,
2 beers, and cinnamon pizza dough dessert.  I had a Butterfinger ice
cream bar at grocery store.

Climb up Molas Pass was long, but the grade was constant and the
weather perfect.  I met an older couple at the pass who are hiking
from Waterton to Durango.  They camped next to me about 1 mile into
Segment 25.

The start of Segment 25 is totally different than Segments 22 and 23.
Smooth singletrack, dirt instead of rocks, lower elevation, and trees!

Day 17 - Monday 2018-09-10
==========================

I met a young girl with an umbrella as a substitute for one trekking
pole.  She was hiking from Durango to Breckenridge or further if
weather holds.

Pellet snow and rain 1 mile before first pass.

Met older guy returning from an out and back.  Doing the CT in pieces
and he wants to finish before he is 70.  Had 1.5 years left.  His wife
no longer drives him to trail heads.

Meet 3 hunters 1/2 mile before ??? Pass.  They barely grunted a
greeting.

Cold and windy at pass.

Passed 2 young guys with a dog thru hiking to Durango.  Started Aug 1.
Doing in memory of their grandfather who hiked the trail in his 60s
but who is now dead.

Had lunch by the ??? (in seg 25) Waterfall.  It was so beautiful that
it was hard to leave.  But I would not want to drink the water (even
if was filtered) because it had stained all of the rocks orange.  A
creek later on stained them all white.

About 0.75 miles into Segment 26 I was traversing a steep slope in my
lowest gear.  This is when my front wheel usually begins to wander.
Well, this time it wandered over the edge and took me with it.  I
tumbled about 20 feet down the steep slope (maybe 45 degrees?)  until
I was brought up short by a tree.  Scrapes on my elbows and knees, but
nothing serious.  It was so steep that it took me awhile to git back
onto the trail.  Probably bent my new derailleur a bit, I will take a
look at it in the morning.  The trail was not extremely narrow at that
point, I was just tired.

Day 18 - Tuesday 2018-09-11
===========================

A elk bugled for about 15 minutes staring at about 04:00.  He did it a
couple more times later in the morning.

A mile after starting, I startled a doe.  But she let me approach to
within 30 feet and then started eating grass.  Very peaceful.

Segment 26 had plenty of singletrack with some hike-a-bike caused by
elevation.

Passed unrecognized guy again.  He thinks that he will finish on
Thursday.

Passed a middle aged blonde woman from Colorado Springs who is thru
hiking.  She started at the end of July, and she thinks she will
finish on Thursday.

Peed in the ??? Wilderness area at lunch.

Just as I was pulling out after lunch, the blonde woman caught up with
me.  She said that a bear ate all of her food at Bear Creek in the
first segment.  She had tied her bear bag just out of her reach, but
apparently not out of the bear's reach.

I saw a number of hunters camps, but no accompanying hunters.

Segment 27 was mostly nice singletrack with some rocky hike-a-bike
mixed in.

I was planning on camping near the end of Segment 27, but I could not
find any good spots.  So I pressed on into Segment 28 and finally
found one at 19:45.  I had to setup in the dark.

Day 19 - Wednesday 2018-09-12
=============================

Because it was the last day, I started late at 10:00.

I startled a large bird that ran along the trail a few feet and then
tried to hide in the brush along the trail.  My best guess is that it
was a turkey hen.

Right before the last 4 mile climb, I talked to an older and younger
pair of hikers who where doing the last few segments.  They told me
that there was a southbound thru biker who was 15 minutes ahead of me.
That did not really make sense and I pushed on.

When I got to the top of the climb, there was a bikepacker that had
just arrived and was taking a break.  This was, and it turns out that
that I had been just behind him for days.  He had even traveled with
the New Mexico couple for a few days.  He had started out backpacking,
but his feet hurt so much that he changed to bikepacking at
Breckenridge.  He had heard stories from multiple people about me.

We then rode into Durango together.  Then we came across a young woman
who was hiking the first few segments from Durango.  I asked her about
the carbon fiber bear container that she was carrying.  She said that
she worked with bears and that the Ursack did not work; the bears
would still destroy your food.  I did not ask if that meant that the
bear actually got something to eat or if it just crushed everything.
I insisted that we stop at Gudy's Rest and sit on the bench for awhile
and contemplated what I had just done.  A half mile before the end of
the trail we passed a young woman who had started from Denver.  I
forget when she started.  We went to Carver Brewing in Durango and
each of us got a free beer for our success.
