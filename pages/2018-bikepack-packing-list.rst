In late summer of 2018, I bikepacked the Colorado Trail solo.  I got
lucky with my equipment selection.  The only exceptions were:

- Except for the Leukotape for blisters and Ibuprofen for soreness, I
  did not use most of the first aid kit, but that was a good thing.
- I did not use most of the bike tools, again a good thing.
- I did not use the pair of Gortex socks.
- The sleeping bag was a little too light for sleeping in the hammock
  which I solved mid-trip by picking up the Therm-a-Rest sleeping pad.
- The cell phone was a PITA.  I usually had it in power saving mode
  which reduced the screen brightness to a minimum.  When I saw a
  picture that I wanted to take, I would have to stop, pull out the
  phone, figure out how to increase the brightness when I could not
  see the dim screen, take the pic, put the phone away.  Probably
  would have been better to pay the weight penalty with a separate
  camera.
